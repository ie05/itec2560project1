## Project: 1 - Speed Reading Tutor

I'm planning to build a speed reader. I've always felt I read slowly and have always wanted to find a way to practice reading faster.

I'm planning to build this and enrich the speeder with some jquery/jquery UI features - especially a slider to adjust the word speed.

Another part I'd like to add in is maybe use facebook's api to add a social component to my project.

This program is hosted on github at: https://ie05.github.io/itec2560project1/
